# Brainvoyager_rename_script
A programm for converting and anonymizing huge amouts of MRT fies via Brainvoyager V2.8 or above

Application:

If you have many MRT data that you want to have renamed/anonymized and converted to a uniform data format via Brain Voyager this is a little program that could help you!
It has the focus on only renaming/anonymizing the patients/clients names for further processing of the data with the need for privacy (ex. external analyzing software/companies).

For the worklow please look in the script :)

If you have any problems please create an issue.
Further development is appreciated.

Thank you in advance,
